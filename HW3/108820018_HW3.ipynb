    "**Univariate polynomial** of degree $d$ has the form $$c_dx^d+c_{d-1}x^{d-1}+\\cdots + c_2x^2+c_1x+c_0,$$ where $c_d\\not= 0$. The $c_i$'s are the \\emph{coefficients}, and $d, d-1, \\cdots$ are the \\emph{exponents}. By definition, $d$ is a nonnegative integer. In this exercise, we assume that all $c_i$s are integers. We represent each polynomial as a *linear list* of coefficients and would like to have some operations (functions) on the polynomials. The first node in the list represents the first terms in the polynomial, the second node represents the second terms, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node contains three fields: *the term's coefficient*, *the term's power*, and *a pointer to the next term*. Write a Python program, that first reads the input file, `inFile.txt`, which has three lines and then performs the indicated operation. The first line is an integer representing the operation defined as below. The second line is the first polynomial and the next line is the second polynomial. The input polynomial, say $4x^3-2x+1$, will be represented as `4x^3-2x+1`. The functions include the following operations:\n",
    "1. `add`: Add two input polynomials.\n",
    "2. `subtract`: Subtract the second polynomial from the first one.\n",
    "3. `multiply`: Multiply two polynomials.\n",
    "4. `divide`: Divide the first polynomial by the second one and return the quotient.\n",
